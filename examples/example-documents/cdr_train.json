            "In unanesthetized , spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine , 5 to 20 micrograms / kg , was inhibited or reversed by nalozone , 0 . 2 to 2 mg / kg .",
            "The hypotensive effect of 100 mg / kg alpha - methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone .",
            "Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate .",
            "In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine , 10 ( - 8 ) to 10 ( - 5 ) M , did not influence stereoselective binding of [ 3H ] - naloxone ( 8 nM ) , and naloxone , 10 ( - 8 ) to 10 ( - 4 ) M , did not influence clonidine - suppressible binding of [ 3H ] - dihydroergocryptine ( 1 nM ) .",
            "These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha - adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors .",
            "As naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site , the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha - methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone ."

            "Multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high - risk stage of choriocarcinoma .",
            "Based on this principle a 27 - year old woman , classified as being in the high - risk group ( Goldstein and Berkowitz score : 11 ) , was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs .",
            "The multiple drug schema consisted of : Etoposide 16 . 213 , Methotrexate , Cyclophosphamide , Actomycin - D , and Cisplatin .",
            "On the first day of the schedule , moderate high doses of Methotrexate , Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide were administered .",
            "Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs , probably originating from the uterus .",
            "Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins , which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces ; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli .",
            "In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations , such as spontaneous necrosis , must be considered less likely .",
            "Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are , according to existing classifications , at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance .",
            "Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment , especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug .",
            "Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta - hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started . ( ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS )"

            "Calcium concentrations 1 day postpartum were higher in cows treated with vitamin D3 about 32 days prepartum ( 8 . 8 mg / 100 ml ) than in control cows ( 5 . 5 mg / 100 ml ) .",

            "Because of the extreme toxicity of vitamin D3 in pregnant Jersey cows and the low margin of safety between doses of vitamin D3 that prevent milk fever and doses that induce milk fever , we concluded that vitamin D3 can not be used practically to prevent milk fever when injected several weeks prepartum ."

            "The major teratogenic outcome is arthrogryposis , presumably due to nicotinic receptor blockade .",
            "However , coniine has failed to produce arthrogryposis in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rabbits .",
            "The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of coniine and nicotine in the developing chick .",
            "Concentrations of coniine and nicotine sulfate were 0 . 015 % , 0 . 03 % , 0 . 075 % , 0 . 15 % , 0 . 75 % , 1 . 5 % , 3 % , and 6 % and 1 % , 5 % , and 10 % , respectively .",
            "Both compounds caused deformations and lethality in a dose - dependent manner .",
            "All concentrations of nicotine sulfate caused some lethality but a no effect level for coniine lethality was 0 . 75 % .",
            "The deformations caused by both coniine and nicotine sulfate were excessive flexion or extension of one or more toes .",
            "No histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group ; however , extensive cranial hemorrhage occurred in all nicotine sulfate - treated chicks .",
            "There was a statistically significant ( P < or = 0 . 01 ) decrease in movement in coniine and nicotine sulfate treated chicks as determined by ultrasound .",
            "Control chicks were in motion an average of 33 . 67 % of the time , while coniine - treated chicks were only moving 8 . 95 % of a 5 - min interval , and no movement was observed for nicotine sulfate treated chicks .",
            "In summary , the chick embryo provides a reliable and simple experimental animal model of coniine - induced arthrogryposis .",
            "Data from this model support a mechanism involving nicotinic receptor blockade with subsequent decreased fetal movement ."

            "BACKGROUND : Although the prevalence of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) is high among elderly patients , few data are available regarding the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in this group of patients .",
            "Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine ( VNB ) or gemcitabine ( GEM ) may obtain a response rate of 20 - 30 % in elderly patients , with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life .",
            "In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed .",
            "METHODS : Forty - nine patients with advanced NSCLC were included , 38 of whom were age > / = 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin .",
            "All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity .",
            "Treatment was comprised of VNB , 25 mg / m ( 2 ) , plus GEM , 1000 mg / m ( 2 ) , both on Days 1 , 8 , and 15 every 28 days .",
            "Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected .",
            "RESULTS : One hundred sixty - five courses were administered , with a median of 3 .",
            "6 courses per patient .",
            "The overall response rate was 26 % ( 95 % confidence interval , 15 - 41 % ) .",
            "Two patients attained a complete response ( 4 % ) and 11 patients ( 22 % ) achieved a partial response .",
            "Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35 % of those patients with an initial value > 0 , whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients ( 55 % ) .",
            "The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1 - year survival rate was 33 % .",
            "Toxicity was mild .",
            "Six patients ( 12 % ) had World Health Organization Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia , 2 patients ( 4 % ) had Grade 3 - 4 thrombocytopenia , and 2 patients ( 4 % ) had Grade 3 neurotoxicity .",
            "Three patients with severe neutropenia ( 6 % ) died of sepsis .",
            "The median age of those patients developing Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients ( 75 years vs . 72 years ; P = 0 . 047 ) .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : The combination of GEM and VNB is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age > / = 75 years .",
            "This age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression .",

            "The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin - treated rats .",
            "Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20 - day - old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42 - day - old rats .",
            "In contrast , no artery calcification could be detected in 10 - month - old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment .",
            "To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin - induced artery calcification in animals of the same age , 20 - day - old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6 - g / d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth .",
            "Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum - fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited group .",
            "Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status can not be determined from the present study , there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification , with 30 % higher levels of serum phosphate in young , ad libitum - fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin - induced artery calcification , ie , the 10 - month - old rats and the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited young rats .",
            "This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin - induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels .",
            "The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification .",
            "High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days .",
            "High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media , but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week .",
            "In the current study , we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D - treated rats at 3 and 4 days .",
            "There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium , which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium .",
            "Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D , the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor .",
            "High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin , and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma - carboxylated .",
            "These observations indicate that although the gamma - carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor , they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites ."

            "METHOD : The response of 44 patients meeting DSM - IV criteria for bipolar disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Bech - Rafaelson Mania Rating Scale .",
            "Patients who experienced a manic or hypomanic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age , sex , diagnosis ( DSM - IV bipolar I vs . bipolar II ) , number of previous manic episodes , type of antidepressant therapy used ( electroconvulsive therapy vs . antidepressant drugs and , more particularly , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [ SSRIs ] ) , use and type of mood stabilizers ( lithium vs . anticonvulsants ) , and temperament of the patient , assessed during a normothymic period using the hyperthymia component of the Semi - structured Affective Temperament Interview .",
            "RESULTS : Switches to hypomania or mania occurred in 27 % of all patients ( N = 12 ) ( and in 24 % of the subgroup of patients treated with SSRIs [ 8 / 33 ] ) ; 16 % ( N = 7 ) experienced manic episodes , and 11 % ( N = 5 ) experienced hypomanic episodes .",
            "Sex , age , diagnosis ( bipolar I vs . bipolar II ) , and additional treatment did not affect the risk of switching .",
            "The incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabilizer .",
            "In contrast , mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium ( 15 % , 4 / 26 ) than in patients not treated with lithium ( 44 % , 8 / 18 ; p = . 04 ) .",
            "The number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching , whereas a high score on the hyperthymia component of the Semistructured Affective Temperament Interview was associated with a greater risk of switching ( p = . 008 ) .",
            "CONCLUSION : The frequency of mood switching associated with acute antidepressant therapy may be reduced by lithium treatment .",

            "We investigated this association , according to the type of progestagen included in third - generation ( i . e . , desogestrel or gestodene ) and second - generation ( i . e . , levonorgestrel ) oral contraceptives , the dose of estrogen , and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS : In a nationwide , population - based , case - control study , we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first myocardial infarction between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a myocardial infarction and who were matched for age , calendar year of the index event , and area of residence .",
            "Subjects supplied information on oral - contraceptive use and major cardiovascular risk factors .",
            "An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS : The odds ratio for myocardial infarction among women who used any type of combined oral contraceptive , as compared with nonusers , was 2 . 0 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 2 . 8 ) .",
            "The adjusted odds ratio was 2 . 5 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 4 . 1 ) among women who used second - generation oral contraceptives and 1 . 3 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 7 to 2 . 5 ) among those who used third - generation oral contraceptives .",
            "Among women who used oral contraceptives , the odds ratio was 2 . 1 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1 . 5 to 3 . 0 ) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1 . 9 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 6 to 5 . 5 ) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS : The risk of myocardial infarction was increased among women who used second - generation oral contraceptives .",
            "The results with respect to the use of third - generation oral contraceptives were inconclusive but suggested that the risk was lower than the risk associated with second - generation oral contraceptives .",
            "The risk of myocardial infarction was similar among women who used oral contraceptives whether or not they had a prothrombotic mutation ."

            "Fifteen female migraineurs ( without aura ) and eight controls participated in the study .",
            "Sublingual nitroglycerin ( 0 . 5 mg ) was administered .",
            "Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times : 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application , and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack ( mean 344 and 404 min ; 12 subjects ) .",
            "In those subjects who had no migraine attack ( 11 subjects ) a similar time schedule was used .",
            "Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine .",
            "In addition , both change and peak , showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity ( P < 0 . 001 ) .",
            "However , plasma CGRP concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack .",
            "Basal CGRP concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5 - HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack .",
            "Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly ( P < 0 . 01 ) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine attack .",
            "In conclusion , the fact that plasma CGRP concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between CGRP and migraine .",
            "In contrast , serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine , it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant CGRP release in this model ."

            "PATIENTS AND METHODS : Patients with more than 50 % decrease in platelet count or thrombocytopenia ( < 150 x 10 ( 9 ) / L ) after exposure to heparin , who had a positive two - step antigen assay [ optical density ( OD ) > 0 . 4 and > 50 inhibition with high concentration of heparin ] were included in the study .",
            "RESULTS : Forty of 94 HIT patients had thrombosis at diagnosis ; 54 / 94 had isolated - HIT without thrombosis .",
            "Eight of the isolated - HIT patients developed thrombosis within the next 30 d ; thus , a total of 48 patients had thrombosis at day 30 .",
            "At diagnosis there was no significant difference in OD between HIT patients with thrombosis and those with isolated - HIT .",
            "However , OD was significantly higher in all patients with thrombosis ( n = 48 , 1 . 34 + / - 0 . 89 ) , including isolated - HIT patients who later developed thrombosis within 30 d ( n = 8 , 1 . 84 + / - 0 . 64 ) as compared to isolated - HIT patients who did not develop thrombosis ( 0 . 96 + / - 0 . 75 ; P = 0 . 011 and P = 0 . 008 ) .",

            "Multivariate analysis showed a 2 . 8 - fold increased risk of thrombosis in females .",
            "Similarly , thrombotic risk increased with age and OD values .",

            "From January 1986 to January 2009 , 1223 consecutive ALF patients were evaluated : ATT alone was the cause in 70 ( 5 . 7 % ) patients .",
            "Another 15 ( 1 . 2 % ) had ATT and simultaneous hepatitis virus infection .",
            "In 44 ( 62 . 8 % ) patients , ATT was prescribed empirically without definitive evidence of tuberculosis .",
            "ATT - ALF patients were younger ( 32 . 87 [ + / - 15 . 8 ] years ) , and 49 ( 70 % ) of them were women .",
            "Most had hyperacute presentation ; the median icterus encephalopathy interval was 4 . 5 ( 0 - 30 ) days .",
            "The median duration of ATT before ALF was 30 ( 7 - 350 ) days .",
            "At presentation , advanced encephalopathy and cerebral edema were present in 51 ( 76 % ) and 29 ( 41 . 4 % ) patients , respectively .",
            "Gastrointestinal bleed , seizures , infection , and acute renal failure were documented in seven ( 10 % ) , five ( 7 . 1 % ) , 26 ( 37 . 1 % ) , and seven ( 10 % ) patients , respectively .",
            "Compared with hepatitis E virus ( HEV ) and non - A non - E - induced ALF , ATT - ALF patients had nearly similar presentations except for older age and less elevation of liver enzymes .",
            "The mortality rate among patients with ATT - ALF was high ( 67 . 1 % , n = 47 ) , and only 23 ( 32 . 9 % ) patients recovered with medical treatment .",
            "In multivariate analysis , three factors independently predicted mortality : serum bilirubin ( > or = 10 . 8 mg / dL ) , prothrombin time ( PT ) prolongation ( > or = 26 seconds ) , and grade III / IV encephalopathy at presentation .",
            "CONCLUSION : ATT - ALF constituted 5 . 7 % of ALF at our center and had a high mortality rate .",
            "Because the mortality rate is so high , determining which factors are predictors is less important .",

            "Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent ( nonepisode biopsy ) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy ( episode biopsy ) .",
            "RESULTS : The main pathologic diagnoses ( some overlap ) were acute rejection ( AR ; n = 4 ) , chronic rejection ( CR ; n = 5 ) , AR + CR ( n = 4 ) , recurrent IgA nephropathy ( n = 5 ) , normal findings ( n = 2 ) , minimal - type chronic FK506 nephropathy ( n = 9 ) , and mild - type FK506 nephropathy ( n = 11 ) .",
            "Of the nonepisode biopsies , 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal - type and mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy , respectively .",
            "Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization ( 5 biopsies ) , arteriolopathy ( angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall ; 20 biopsies ) , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( 4 biopsies ) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis ( 11 biopsies ) .",
            "The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy group , which included 7 episode biopsies , were statistically higher than those in the minimum - type chronic FK506 - nephropathy group ( P < 0 . 001 ) .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall , and suggests that mild - type chronic FK506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function ."

            "Native kidney specimens included a wide range of glomerulopathies as well as cases of thrombotic microangiopathy , malignant hypertension , acute interstitial nephritis , and acute tubular necrosis .",

            "At doses where alone , they produced no significant effects on locomotion , BD1018 , BD1063 and LR132 significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine .",
            "To further validate the hypothesis that the anti - cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors , an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine .",

            "METHODS : We conducted a prospective , randomized , double - blind study in the emergency department of a central - city teaching hospital .",
            "Patients aged 18 years or older treated with prochlorperazine for headache , nausea , or vomiting were eligible for inclusion .",
            "Study participants were randomized to receive 10 mg of prochlorperazine administered intravenously by means of 2 - minute push ( bolus group ) or 10 mg diluted in 50 mL of normal saline solution administered by means of intravenous infusion during a 15 - minute period ( infusion group ) .",
            "The main outcome was the number of study participants experiencing akathisia within 60 minutes of administration .",
            "Akathisia was defined as either a spontaneous report of restlessness or agitation or a change of 2 or more in the patient - reported akathisia rating scale and a change of at least 1 in the investigator - observed akathisia rating scale .",

            "We have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine ( mixed alpha2 - / I1 - receptor agonist ) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction .",
            "The present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2 - and / or I1 - receptors .",
            "Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine ( 600 microg / kg ) or alpha - methyldopa ( 100 mg / kg ) , selective I1 - and alpha2 - receptor agonists , respectively , in blood pressure , hemodynamic variability , and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham - operated and ovariectomized ( Ovx ) Sprague - Dawley female rats with or without 12 - wk estrogen replacement .",
            "Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed : the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat - to - beat intervals ( SDRR ) and the root mean square of successive differences in R - wave - to - R - wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability .",
            "In sham - operated rats , rilmenidine or alpha - methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure .",
            "SDRR was reduced only by alpha - methyldopa .",
            "Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha - methyldopa , in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension .",
            "The enhanced alpha - methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a reduced locomotor activity .",
            "Estrogen replacement ( 17beta - estradiol subcutaneous pellet , 14 . 2 microg / day , 12 wk ) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of alpha - methyldopa to sham - operated levels .",
            "These findings suggest that estrogen downregulates alpha2 - but not I1 - receptor - mediated hypotension and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in alpha - methyldopa - estrogen interaction ."

            "METHODS : Thirty - nine postmenopausal women with osteopenia or osteoporosis were included in this prospective , controlled clinical study .",
            "Twenty - five women were given raloxifene hydrochloride ( 60 mg / day ) plus calcium ( 500 mg / day ) .",
            "Age - matched controls ( n = 14 ) were given only calcium .",
            "Plasma TAFI , tPA , and PAI - 1 antigen levels were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment by commercially available ELISA kits .",
            "Variations of individuals were assessed by Wilcoxon 's test .",
            "Relationship between those markers and demographic characteristics were investigated .",
            "RESULTS : Three months of raloxifene treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the plasma TAFI antigen concentrations ( 16 % change , P < 0 . 01 ) , and a significant increase in tPA antigen concentrations ( 25 % change , P < 0 . 05 ) .",
            "A significant correlation was found between baseline TAFI antigen concentrations and the duration of amenorrhea ( P < 0 . 05 ; r = 0 . 33 ) .",
            "CONCLUSION : We suggest that the increased risk of venous thromboembolism due to raloxifene treatment may be related to increased tPA levels , but not TAFI levels ."

            "In almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present ( n = 11 ) , while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present in less than 20 % ( OR 3 . 1 ; 95 % CI , 1 . 1 - 8 . 5 , adjusted for age , years since menopause , smoking , and body mass index ) .",

            "Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis , autoimmunity , cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation .",
            "Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors , it has been designated a ' non - nephrotoxic drug ' .",
            "However , clinical reports suggest that , under some circumstances , sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction .",
            "A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre - existing chronic renal damage .",
            "The mechanisms of sirolimus - associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal .",
            "It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability / injury , but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive .",
            "The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus ( such as in delayed graft function ) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival / repair processes .",
            "Although these adverse effects occur in some patients , their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney , the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations , close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function , use of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed .",
            "Further long - term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future ."

            "BACKGROUND : Cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties .",
            "While the mechanisms underlying cocaine 's rewarding effects have been studied extensively , less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine , such as anxiety .",
            "METHODS : In this study , we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta - hydroxylase knockout ( Dbh - / - ) mice , which lack norepinephrine ( NE ) , in the elevated plus maze ( EPM ) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine - induced anxiety .",
            "RESULTS : We found that cocaine dose - dependently increased anxiety - like behavior in control ( Dbh + / - ) mice , as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration .",
            "The Dbh - / - mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine .",
            "Cocaine - induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh + / - mice following administration of disulfiram , a dopamine beta - hydroxylase ( DBH ) inhibitor .",
            "In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists , we found that pretreatment with the beta - adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine - induced anxiety - like behavior in Dbh + / - and wild - type C57BL6 / J mice , while the alpha ( 1 ) antagonist prazosin and the alpha ( 2 ) antagonist yohimbine had no effect .",

            "However , the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor produce schizophrenic - like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor .",
            "As a result , there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor .",
            "Among them are glycine transporter - 1 ( GlyT1 ) inhibitors such as SSR103800 , which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine ( a co - agonist for the NMDA receptor ) levels in the synapse .",
            "This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic - like properties of SSR103800 , with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity , involving either drug challenge ( ie , amphetamine and MK - 801 ) or transgenic mice ( ie , NMDA Nr1 ( neo - / - ) and DAT ( - / - ) ) .",
            "Results showed that SSR103800 ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . ) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non - competitive NMDA receptor antagonist , MK - 801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of NMDA Nr1 ( neo - / - ) mice .",
            "In contrast , SSR103800 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter ( DAT ( - / - ) ) knockout mice ( 10 - 30 mg / kg p . o . ) .",
            "Importantly , both classical ( haloperidol ) and atypical ( olanzapine , clozapine and aripiprazole ) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity .",
            "However , unlike these latter , SSR103800 did not produce catalepsy ( retention on the bar test ) up to 30 mg / kg p . o .",
            "Together these findings show that the GlyT1 inhibitor , SSR103800 , produces antipsychotic - like effects , which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system , and has a reduced side - effect potential as compared with these latter drugs ."

            "Heart rate ( HR ) , MAP , stroke volume ( SV ) , cardiac output ( CO ) , and frontal lobe oxygenation ( S ( c ) O ( 2 ) ) were registered .",
            "RESULTS : Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP , HR , SV , and CO concomitant with an elevation in S ( c ) O ( 2 ) .",
            "After administration of phenylephrine , MAP increased ( 51 + / - 12 to 81 + / - 13 mmHg ; P < 0 . 001 ; mean + / - SD ) .",
            "However , a 14 % ( from 70 + / - 8 % to 60 + / - 7 % ) reduction in S ( c ) O ( 2 ) ( P < 0 . 05 ) followed with no change in CO ( 3 . 7 + / - 1 . 1 to 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 9 l min ( - 1 ) ) .",
            "The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP ( 53 + / - 9 to 79 + / - 8 mmHg ; P < 0 . 001 ) , restored CO ( 3 . 2 + / - 1 . 2 to 5 . 0 + / - 1 . 3 l min ( - 1 ) ) , and preserved S ( c ) O ( 2 ) .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : The utilization of phenylephrine to correct hypotension induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on S ( c ) O ( 2 ) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in CO ."

            "In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined .",
            "In addition , the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine .",
            "Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague - Dawley rats tested in photocell cages .",
            "Nicotine ( 1 . 0 mg / kg ) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment , but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment .",
            "The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium , indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors .",
            "Nicotine - induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390 , the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1 / D2 antagonist fluphenazine .",

            "The effect appears to be mediated by central nicotine receptors , possibly located on dopaminergic neurons , and also requires the activation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors ."

            "Twenty - two patients in the affected group had abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4 , 000 to 8 , 000 Hz and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels .",
            "When deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed , audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks , and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic .",
            "Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability .",
            "Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg / kg per dose , therapy was restarted with lower doses , usually 50 mg / kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality , and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated .",
            "Auditory deterioration and improvement , demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine , respectively , provided convincing evidence for a cause - and - effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity .",
            "Based on these data , a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine .",
            "A dose of 50 mg / kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities .",
            "With mild toxicity , a reduction to 30 or 40 mg / kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks .",
            "Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg / kg per dose with careful monitoring .",
            "In those with symptoms of hearing loss , the drug should be stopped for four weeks , and when the audiogram is stable or improved , therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg / kg per dose .",
            "Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction ."

            "Hemolysis of human erythrocytes induced by tamoxifen is related to disruption of membrane structure .",

            "This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes , attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM - induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms .",
            "TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration .",
            "The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples , but 12 . 5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions .",
            "Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis , TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes .",
            "The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha - tocopherol ( alpha - T ) and alpha - tocopherol acetate ( alpha - TAc ) ( inactivated functional hydroxyl ) indicating that TAM - induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage .",
            "This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM - induced hemolysis .",
            "Furthermore , it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH , thus ruling out TAM - induced cell oxidative stress .",
            "Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K ( + ) from the cells , also excluding a colloid - osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis , according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves .",
            "However , TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane - cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3 .",
            "Either alpha - T or alpha - TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes .",
            "These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided .",
            "Therefore , TAM - induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane , leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane .",
            "These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM , resulting in hemolytic anemia .",
            "Additionally , since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity , the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by TAM may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action ."

            "To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of Na + , we studied the response of cardiac ( Na , K ) - ATPase to NO - deficient hypertension induced in rats by NO - synthase inhibition with 40 mg / kg / day N ( G ) - nitro - L - arginine methyl ester ( L - NAME ) for 4 four weeks .",
            "After 4 - week administration of L - NAME , the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) increased by 36 % .",

            "During activation with Na + , the Vmax remained unchanged , however the K ( Na ) increased by 50 % , indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the Na + - binding site in NO - deficient rats .",

            "It has been shown that bromocriptine - induced tachycardia , which persisted after adrenalectomy , is ( i ) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and ( ii ) reduced by 5 - day isoproterenol pretreatment , supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart .",
            "This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine - induced tachycardia in conscious rats .",
            "Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate .",
            "In control rats , intravenous bromocriptine ( 150 microg / kg ) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia .",
            "Bromocriptine - induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment , while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia , an effect that was partly reduced by i . v .",
            "domperidone ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .",
            "Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment .",
            "In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol - pretreated rats , the isoproterenol - induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced , compared with saline - pretreated rats ( the EC50 of the isoproterenol - induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22 - fold ) .",
            "These results show that 15 - day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine - induced tachycardia to bradycardia , an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta - adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart .",
            "They suggest that , in normal conscious rats , the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine D2 receptors ."

            "Previous investigations have determined that , in response to clonidine , ultrasound production increases through the 2nd - week postpartum and decreases thereafter .",
            "Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern , and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia , we hypothesized that clonidine 's developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other .",
            "Therefore , in the present experiment , the effects of clonidine administration ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2 - , 8 - , 15 - , and 20 - day - old rats .",
            "Age - related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables , including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine - induced bradycardia .",
            "This experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by - product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for clonidine 's detrimental effects on cardiovascular function ."

            "Grape seed extract , primarily a mixture of proanthocyanidins , has been shown to modulate a wide - range of biological , pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective .",
            "This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract ( GSPE ) to prevent acetaminophen ( AAP ) - induced nephrotoxicity , amiodarone ( AMI ) - induced lung toxicity , and doxorubicin ( DOX ) - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .",
            "Experimental design consisted of four groups : control ( vehicle alone ) , GSPE alone , drug alone and GSPE + drug .",
            "For the cytoprotection study , animals were orally gavaged 100 mg / Kg GSPE for 7 - 10 days followed by i . p .",
            "injections of organ specific three drugs ( AAP : 500 mg / Kg for 24 h ; AMI : 50 mg / Kg / day for four days ; DOX : 20 mg / Kg for 48 h ) .",
            "Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA ( both endonuclease - dependent and independent ) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and / or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues .",
            "Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP , AMI and DOX , provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation .",
            "Histopathological examination of kidney , heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of GSPE preexposure than in its presence .",
            "GSPE + drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery .",
            "Additionally , histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation .",
            "Interestingly , all the drugs , such as , AAP , AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE .",
            "Since AAP , AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo , the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and / or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals .",
            "In addition , its ' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute , which played a role in the chemoprevention process .",
            "Additionally , this may have been the first report on AMI - induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue .",
            "Taken together , these events undoubtedly establish GSPE 's abundant bioavailability , and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo ."

            "METHODS : We used computerized pharmacy records to identify all adult psychiatric inpatients treated with clozapine ( 1995 - 96 ) , reviewed their medical records to score incidence and severity of delirium , and tested associations with potential risk factors .",
            "RESULTS : Subjects ( n = 139 ) were 72 women and 67 men , aged 40 . 8 + / - 12 . 1 years , hospitalized for 24 . 9 + / - 23 . 3 days , and given clozapine , gradually increased to an average daily dose of 282 + / - 203 mg ( 3 . 45 + / - 2 . 45 mg / kg ) for 18 . 9 + / - 16 . 4 days .",
            "Delirium was diagnosed in 14 ( 10 . 1 % incidence , or 1 . 48 cases / person - years of exposure ) ; 71 . 4 % of cases were moderate or severe .",
            "Associated factors were co - treatment with other centrally antimuscarinic agents , poor clinical outcome , older age , and longer hospitalization ( by 17 . 5 days , increasing cost ) ; sex , diagnosis or medical co - morbidity , and daily clozapine dose , which fell with age , were unrelated .",

            "Thirty - five lamivudine - na ve HBV infected patients with or without HIV co - infection were studied : 15 chronic HBV mono - infected patients and 20 HBV - HIV co - infected patients .",

            "BACKGROUND : Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection , and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) - based regimens .",
            "To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus .",
            "We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use .",
            "In each patient , the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria .",
            "METHODS : We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999 - 2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen .",
            "In these patients , the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein : creatinine ratios , an estimate of grams of proteinuria / day .",
            "Laboratory results were compared between prior , during and following sirolimus use .",
            "RESULTS : Twenty - eight patients ( 24 % ) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post - transplantation course .",
            "In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive .",
            "In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic - range proteinuria .",
            "Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables .",
            "In most patients , discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease , but not resolution , of proteinuria .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : Sirolimus induces or aggravates pre - existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients .",
            "Proteinuria may improve , but does not resolve , when sirolimus is withdrawn ."

            "OBJECTIVES : The United Kingdom Parkinson 's Disease Research Group ( UKPDRG ) trial found an increased mortality in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) randomized to receive 10 mg selegiline per day and L - dopa compared with those taking L - dopa alone .",
            "Recently , we found that therapy with selegiline and L - dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline .",
            "This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure .",
            "The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension .",
            "METHODS : The cardiovascular responses to standing and head - up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn .",
            "RESULTS : Head - up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline , one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures .",
            "A lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing .",
            "Orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug .",
            "Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action .",
            "CONCLUSION : This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L - dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension .",
            "The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non - selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of amphetamine and metamphetamine are discussed ."

            "Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP / dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level .",

            "The increase in dP / dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non - ischemic group .",
            "dP / dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results , giving an ECG - enhanced value , and compared to ECG alone .",
            "RESULTS : The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16 % to 79 % , positive predictive value increased from 60 % to 68 % and negative predictive value from 54 % to 78 % , and specificity decreased from 90 % to 67 % .",

            "Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with cisplatin - based chemotherapy were assessable for toxicity and response .",
            "VNB was administered weekly as a 25 - mg / m2 short intravenous ( i . v . ) infusion .",

            "The emergence of new active drugs might translate into more effective regimens for the treatment of this disease .",
            "METHODS : The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility , response rate , and toxicity of a paclitaxel , cisplatin , and gemcitabine combination to treat metastatic NSCLC .",
            "Thirty - five consecutive chemotherapy - naive patients with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 - 2 were treated with a combination of paclitaxel ( 135 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 3 hours ) on Day 1 , cisplatin ( 120 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 6 hours ) on Day 1 , and gemcitabine ( 800 mg / m ( 2 ) given intravenously in 30 minutes ) on Days 1 and 8 , every 4 weeks .",
            "Although responding patients were scheduled to receive consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received preplanned second - line chemotherapy after disease progression , the response and toxicity rates reported refer only to the chemotherapy regimen given .",
            "RESULTS : All the patients were examined for toxicity ; 34 were examinable for response .",
            "An objective response was observed in 73 . 5 % of the patients ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 55 . 6 - 87 . 1 % ) , including 4 complete responses ( 11 . 7 % ) .",
            "According to intention - to - treat , the overall response rate was 71 . 4 % ( 95 % CI , 53 .",
            "7 - 85 . 4 % ) .",
            "After 154 courses of therapy , the median dose intensity was 131 mg / m ( 2 ) for paclitaxel ( 97 . 3 % ) , 117 mg / m ( 2 ) for cisplatin ( 97 . 3 % ) , and 1378 mg / m ( 2 ) for gemcitabine ( 86 . 2 % ) .",
            "World Health Organization Grade 3 - 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 39 . 9 % and 11 . 4 % of patients , respectively .",
            "There was one treatment - related death .",
            "Nonhematologic toxicities were mild .",
            "After a median follow - up of 22 months , the median progression free survival rate was 7 months , and the median survival time was 16 months .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : The combination of paclitaxel , cisplatin , and gemcitabine is well tolerated and shows high activity in metastatic NSCLC .",
            "This treatment merits further comparison with other cisplatin - based regimens ."

            "OBJECTIVE : The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer 's disease .",
            "METHOD : In a 6 - week random - assignment , double - blind , placebo - controlled trial ( phase A ) , haloperidol , 2 - 3 mg / day ( standard dose ) , and haloperidol , 0 . 50 - 0 . 75 mg / day ( low dose ) , were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer 's disease .",
            "For the subsequent 6 - week double - blind crossover phase ( phase B ) , patients taking standard - or low - dose haloperidol were switched to placebo , and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard - or low - dose haloperidol .",
            "RESULTS : For the 60 patients who completed phase A , standard - dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low - dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation .",
            "Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose ( 55 % - 60 % ) than the low dose ( 25 % - 35 % ) and placebo ( 25 % - 30 % ) .",
            "The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B .",
            "In phase A , extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions , primarily because of a subgroup ( 20 % ) who developed moderate to severe signs .",
            "Low - dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2 - 3 mg / day , although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs .",
            "A starting dose of 1 mg / day with gradual , upward dose titration is recommended .",
            "The narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Alzheimer 's disease patients with psychosis and disruptive behaviors ."

            "This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage .",
            "Therefore , we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats .",
            "METHODS : Renal ACE activity ( Hip - His - Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates ) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats .",
            "After 1 week of recovery , proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [ 1 . 5 mg / kg intravenously ( i . v . ) n = 18 ; controls , saline i . v .",

            "Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks .",
            "After 12 weeks , rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested .",
            "RESULTS : As anticipated , adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria , renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis .",
            "Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin ( r = 0 . 62 , P < 0 . 01 ) , renal interstitial alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0 . 49 , P < 0 . 05 ) , interstitial macrophage influx ( r = 0 . 56 , P < 0 . 05 ) , interstitial collagen III ( r = 0 . 53 , P < 0 . 05 ) , glomerular alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0 . 74 , P < 0 . 01 ) and glomerular desmin ( r = 0 . 48 , P < 0 . 05 ) .",
            "Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis ( r = 0 . 22 , NS ) .",
            "In controls , no predictive values for renal parameters were observed .",

            "MATERIALS AND METHODS : From November 2005 to September 2007 , 8 patients ( 5 men and 3 women ) were diagnosed as having metronidazole - induced encephalopathy ( age range ; 43 - 78 years ) .",
            "They had been taking metronidazole ( total dosage , 45 - 120 g ; duration , 30 days to 2 months ) to treat the infection in various organs .",
            "Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) were obtained after the hospitalization , including DWI ( 8 / 8 ) , apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) map ( 4 / 8 ) , FLAIR ( 7 / 8 ) , and T2 - weighted image ( 8 / 8 ) .",
            "Follow - up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration .",
            "Findings of initial and follow - up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus , to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities , their locations , and signal changes on follow - up images .",
            "RESULTS : Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR ( or T2 - weighted image ) at the dentate nucleus ( 8 / 8 ) , inferior colliculus ( 6 / 8 ) , corpus callosum ( 2 / 8 ) , pons ( 2 / 8 ) , medulla ( 1 / 8 ) , and bilateral cerebral white matter ( 1 / 8 ) .",
            "High - signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map ( 3 / 4 ) , but in one patient , high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map .",
            "All the lesions in dentate , inferior colliculus , pons , and medullas had been resolved completely on follow - up MRIs in 5 patients , but in 1 patient of them , corpus callosal lesion persisted .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : Reversible inferior colliculus lesions could be considered as the characteristic for metronidazole - induced encephalopathy , next to the dentate nucleus involvement ."

            "BACKGROUND : Cardiac troponins I ( cTnI ) and T ( cTnT ) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial cell injury .",
            "We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin ( DOX ) - induced cardiomyopathy , and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model .",
            "METHODS : Thirty - five Wistar rats were given 1 . 5 mg / kg DOX , i . v . , weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg / kg BW .",
            "Ten rats received saline as a control group .",
            "cTnI was measured with Access ( R ) ( ng / ml ) and a research immunoassay ( pg / ml ) , and compared with cTnT , CK - MB mass and CK .",
            "By using transthoracic echocardiography , anterior and posterior wall thickness , LV diameters and LV fractional shortening ( FS ) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline , and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats .",
            "Histology was performed in DOX - rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls .",
            "RESULTS : Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9 - week period .",
            "End - diastolic ( ED ) and end - systolic ( ES ) LV diameters / BW significantly increased , whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the DOX group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .",
            "These parameters remained unchanged in controls .",
            "Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis .",
            "In 7 of the 18 rats , degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found .",
            "Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis .",
            "A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7 . 5 and 12 mg / kg in comparison with baseline ( p < 0 . 05 ) .",
            "cTnT found in rats after 12 mg / kg were significantly greater than that found after 7 . 5 mg / kg DOX .",
            "Maximal cTnI ( pg / ml ) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls ( p = 0 . 006 , 0 . 007 ) .",
            "cTnI ( ng / ml ) , CK - MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls .",
            "All markers remained stable in controls .",
            "Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters / BW ( r = 0 . 81 and 0 . 65 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .",
            "A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes , and between LV diameters / BW and histological findings .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats , cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes .",
            "Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX , probably due to heterogeneity in cross - reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms , it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments ."

            "In order to increase clot stability , FS typically contain aprotinin , a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor .",
            "Recently , synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid ( tAMCA ) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin .",
            "However , tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures .",
            "We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS .",
            "METHOD : FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA ( 0 . 5 - 47 . 5 mg / ml ) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats .",
            "The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia .",
            "FINDINGS : FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours .",
            "The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA .",
            "Thus , FS containing 47 . 5 mg / ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats ( n = 6 ) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA ( 0 . 5 mg / ml ) only evoked brief episodes of jerk - correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats .",
            "In contrast , FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity .",
            "INTERPRETATION : Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS .",
            "Thus , use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient ."

            "After a 30 - min baseline measure of locomotor activity ( day 0 ) , animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12 - h deprivation followed by 12 - h access to 10 % sucrose solution and chow pellets ( 12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period ) for 21 days .",
            "Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access .",
            "Beginning on day 22 , all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow .",
            "Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine ( 0 . 5 mg / kg ) .",
            "The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups ( ad libitum 10 % sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection , cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection , ad libitum chow with amphetamine , or cyclic 10 % sucrose and chow with a saline injection ) .",
            "These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine , possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system ."

            "Preliminary results of an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group study of single - agent paclitaxel ( Taxol ; Bristol - Myers Squibb Company , Princeton , NJ ) reported a 37 % response rate in patients with head and neck cancer , and the paclitaxel / cisplatin combination has been used successfully and has significantly improved median response duration in ovarian cancer patients .",
            "We initiated a phase I / II trial to determine the response and toxicity of escalating paclitaxel doses combined with fixed - dose cisplatin with granulocyte colony - stimulating factor support in patients with untreated locally advanced inoperable head and neck carcinoma .",
            "To date , 23 men with a median age of 50 years and good performance status have entered the trial .",
            "Primary tumor sites were oropharynx , 10 patients ; hypopharynx , four ; larynx , two ; oral cavity , three ; unknown primary , two ; and nasal cavity and parotid gland , one each .",

            "Treatment , given every 21 days for a maximum of three cycles , consisted of paclitaxel by 3 - hour infusion followed the next day by a fixed dose of cisplatin ( 75 mg / m2 ) .",
            "The dose levels incorporate escalating paclitaxel doses , and intrapatient escalations within a given dose level are permitted if toxicity permits .",
            "At the time of this writing , dose level 4 ( 260 , 270 , and 280 mg / m2 ) is being evaluated ; three patients from this level are evaluable .",

            "Gamma - hexachlorocyclohexane ( gamma - HCH ) , the active ingredient of the insecticide lindane , has been shown to decrease seizure threshold to pentylenetrazol ( PTZ ) 3 h after exposure to gamma - HCH and conversely increase threshold to PTZ - induced seizures 24 h after exposure to gamma - HCH ( Vohland et al . 1981 ) .",
            "In this study , the severity of response to other seizure - inducing agents was tested in mice 1 and 24 h after intraperitoneal administration of 80 mg / kg gamma - HCH .",
            "One hour after the administration of gamma - HCH , the activity of seizure - inducing agents was increased , regardless of their mechanism , while 24 h after gamma - HCH a differential response was observed .",
            "Seizure activity due to PTZ and picrotoxin ( PTX ) was significantly decreased ; however , seizure activity due to 3 - mercaptopropionic acid ( MPA ) , bicuculline ( BCC ) , methyl 6 , 7 - dimethoxy - 4 - ethyl - B - carboline - 3 - carboxylate ( DMCM ) , or strychnine ( STR ) was not different from control .",
            "In vitro , gamma - HCH , pentylenetetrazol and picrotoxin were shown to inhibit 3H - TBOB binding in mouse whole brain , with IC50 values of 4 . 6 , 404 and 9 . 4 microM , respectively .",
            "MPA , BCC , DMCM , and STR showed no inhibition of 3H - TBOB ( t - butyl bicyclo - orthobenzoate ) binding at concentrations of 100 micron .",
            "The pharmacological challenge data suggest that tolerance may occur to seizure activity induced by PTZ and PTX 24 h after gamma - HCH , since the response to only these two seizure - inducing agents is decreased .",
            "The in vitro data suggest that the site responsible for the decrease in seizure activity 24 h after gamma - HCH may be the GABA - A receptor - linked chloride channel ."

            "Severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas .",
            "BACKGROUND : Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood .",
            "With current treatment regimens including combined surgery , radiation and chemotherapy , the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year .",
            "Therefore , patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen .",
            "Generally , carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin , whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known .",
            "However , we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin , which is infrequently reported .",
            "CASE : A 58 - year - old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe .",
            "He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection .",
            "Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen .",
            "RESULTS : He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection .",
            "Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle - closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished , inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks .",
            "Finally , 6 weeks later , diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost .",
            "CONCLUSION : When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin , we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity .",
            "It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects ."

            "Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this , although it may also improve analgesia .",
            "METHODS : This double - blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients .",
            "Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl , while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl .",
            "RESULTS : Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting , but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and / or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20 % and 17 % with fentanyl and fentanyl - dexamethasone , respectively , to 5 % ( P = 0 . 013 ) .",
            "Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24 % and 31 % to 7 % ( P = 0 . 0012 ) .",
            "Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting .",
            "Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids , reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35 % and 33 % to 22 % and 19 % ( P = 0 . 049 and P = 0 . 035 ) , respectively , while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42 % to 27 % ( P = 0 . 034 ) .",
            "Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl .",
            "Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane - sparing effect and increased respiratory depression , hypotension and bradycardia .",
            "CONCLUSION : As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects , it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery ."

            "BACKGROUND : Sirolimus ( SRL ) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation .",
            "These are nephrotoxic , but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects , although this question is still open .",
            "In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described .",
            "The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function , including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine A ( CsA ) , tacrolimus ( FK506 ) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations .",
            "METHODS : For a period of 2 weeks , CsA 15 mg / kg / day ( given orally ) , FK506 3 . 0 mg / kg / day ( given orally ) or SRL 0 . 4 mg / kg / day ( given intraperitoneally ) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague - Dawley rats .",
            "In the ' conscious catheterized rat ' model , the glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) was measured as the clearance of Cr ( EDTA ) .",
            "The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi - quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis , subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules , plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red .",
            "RESULTS : CsA , FK506 and SRL all significantly decreased the GFR .",
            "A further deterioration was seen when CsA was combined with either FK506 or SRL , whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with FK506 plus SRL when compared with treatment with any of the single substances .",
            "The morphological changes presented a similar pattern .",
            "The semi - quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL ( P < 0 . 001 compared with controls ) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls ( P < 0 . 02 ) .",
            "The FK506 plus SRL combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls ( P = 0 . 05 ) .",
            "CONCLUSION : This rat study demonstrated a synergistic nephrotoxic effect of CsA plus SRL , whereas FK506 plus SRL was better tolerated ."

            "The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters ( glutamate , aspartate , glycine and GABA ) of N - ( 2 - propylpentanoyl ) urea ( VPU ) in comparison to its parent compound , valproic acid ( VPA ) .",
            "VPU was more potent than VPA , exhibiting the median effective dose ( ED ( 50 ) ) of 49 mg / kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine - induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg / kg .",
            "In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA .",
            "Pretreatment with either VPU ( 50 and 100 mg / kg ) or VPA ( 300 and 600 mg / kg ) completely abolished pilocarpine - evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate .",
            "In addition , a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level .",
            "Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine - induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate .",
            "Therefore , like VPA , the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine - induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account , at least partly , for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine - induced seizure in experimental animals .",
            "Some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated ."

            "Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported , the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice .",
            "We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone .",
            "METHODS : We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice .",
            "Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia ( K ( + ) > 5 . 0 mEq / L ) or renal insufficiency ( Cr > or = 2 . 5 mg / dL ) , and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case .",
            "Clinical characteristics , medications , and serum chemistries at baseline and follow - up time periods were compared .",
            "RESULTS : Sixty - seven of 926 patients ( 7 . 2 % ) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia ( n = 33 ) or renal failure ( n = 34 ) .",
            "Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes , had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses , and were more likely to be treated with beta - blockers than controls ( n = 134 ) .",
            "Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine , required higher doses of loop diuretics , and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : Spironolactone - induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously .",
            "This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta - blockers ."

            "BACKGROUND : The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic .",
            "Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLTX ) has dramatically improved success rates .",
            "Recently , however , we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) .",
            "This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in OLTX patients .",
            "METHODS : Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied ( n = 834 ) .",
            "Our prospectively collected database was the source of information .",
            "Patients were divided into three groups : Controls , no CRF or ESRD , n = 748 ; CRF , sustained serum creatinine > 2 . 5 mg / dl , n = 41 ; and ESRD , n = 45 .",
            "Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables , diagnosis , postoperative variables , survival , type of ESRD therapy , and survival from onset of ESRD .",
            "RESULTS : At 13 years after OLTX , the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18 . 1 % ( CRF 8 . 6 % and ESRD 9 . 5 % ) .",
            "Compared with control patients , CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels , a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome , higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively , and a higher 1 - year serum creatinine .",
            "Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year , 3 months , and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2 . 6 , 2 . 2 , and 1 . 6 , respectively .",
            "Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups , but by year 13 , the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28 . 2 % compared with 54 . 6 % in the control group .",
            "Patients developing ESRD had a 6 - year survival after onset of ESRD of 27 % for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71 . 4 % for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : Patients who are more than 10 years post - OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate .",
            "The development of ESRD decreases survival , particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only .",
            "Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1 - year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome .",
            "However , an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD .",
            "New strategies for long - term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication ."

            "We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of BP reduction .",
            "METHODS : Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke ( within 24 hours ) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo ( n = 100 ) , 1 mg / h ( low - dose ) nimodipine ( n = 101 ) , or 2 mg / h ( high - dose ) nimodipine ( n = 94 ) .",
            "The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed .",
            "RESULTS : Two hundred sixty - five patients were included in this analysis ( n = 92 , 93 , and 80 for placebo , low dose , and high dose , respectively ) .",
            "Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP ( SBP ) and diastolic BP ( DBP ) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days .",
            "In multivariate analysis , a significant correlation between DBP reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high - dose group ( beta = 0 . 49 , P = 0 .",
            "048 ) .",
            "Patients with a DBP reduction of > or = 20 % in the high - dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable death or dependency ( Barthel Index < 60 ) ( n / N = 25 / 26 , OR 10 .",
            "16 , 95 % CI 1 . 02 to 101 . 74 ) and death alone ( n / N = 9 / 26 , OR 4 . 336 , 95 % CI 1 . 131 16 . 619 ) compared with all placebo patients ( n / N = 62 / 92 and 14 / 92 , respectively ) .",
            "There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : DBP , but not SBP , reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high - dose nimodipine after acute stroke .",
            "For low - dose nimodipine , the results were not conclusive .",

            "BACKGROUND : Recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms ( TNSs ) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine .",
            "However , identification of a short - acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal .",
            "Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine .",
            "Accordingly , the present , prospective double - blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs .",
            "METHODS : Ninety patients classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2 . 5 ml 2 % lidocaine in 7 . 5 % glucose , 2 % prilocaine in 7 . 5 % glucose , or 0 . 5 % bupivacaine in 7 . 5 % glucose .",
            "All solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmacy .",
            "Details of spinal puncture , extension and regression of spinal block , and the times to reach discharge criteria were noted .",
            "In the evening of postoperative day 1 , patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure .",
            "RESULTS : Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs , 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine ( P = 0 . 03 ) had them , and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs .",
            "Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine ( 150 vs . 165 min and 238 vs . 253 min , respectively ) but prolonged after bupivacaine ( 200 and 299 min , respectively ; P < 0 . 05 ) .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : Prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of TNSs ."

            "After 12weeks , animals were euthanized , and CaCl ( 2 ) - treated , CaCl ( 2 ) - untreated ( n = 12 ) and NaCl - treated aortic segments ( n = 12 ) were collected for histological and molecular assessments .",
            "MMP - TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi - quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry .",
            "RESULTS : Despite similar external diameters among CaCl ( 2 ) - treated , non - CaCl ( 2 ) - treated and NaCl - treated segments , aneurymal alteration ( n = 6 , 50 % ) , media degeneration with regional disruption , fragmentation of elastic fiber , and increased collagen deposition ( n = 12 , 100 % ) were demonstrated in CaCl ( 2 ) - treated segments .",
            "MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl ( 2 ) - treated segments ( all p < 0 . 01 ) , with trends of elevation in CaCl ( 2 ) - untreated segments , as compared with NaCl - treated segments .",
            "Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP - 2 , MMP - 9 , ADAM - 10 and ADAM - 17 ( all p < 0 . 01 ) in intima and media for CaCl ( 2 ) - treated segments .",

            "Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this , the mechanisms are poorly understood .",
            "We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility : pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen - induced LH surge .",
            "Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40 % reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats , but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol .",
            "Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid - induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge .",
            "Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors ( PRL - R ) and components of prolactin 's signaling pathway .",
            "To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL - R expression and sensitivity to prolactin , we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin - induced STAT5 activation .",
            "Lastly , we measured PRL - R and suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS - 1 and - 3 and CIS , which reflect the level of prolactin signaling ) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol .",
            "Sulpiride induced only SOCS - 1 in the medial preoptic area , where GnRH neurons are regulated , but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus , PRL - R , SOCS - 3 , and CIS mRNA levels were also induced .",
            "Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS - 3 and CIS .",
            "Interestingly , estradiol also induced PRL - R , SOCS - 3 , and CIS mRNA levels independently .",

            "Upregulation of brain expression of P - glycoprotein in MRP2 - deficient TR ( - ) rats resembles seizure - induced up - regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats .",
            "PURPOSE : The multidrug resistance protein 2 ( MRP2 ) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood - brain barrier ( BBB ) .",
            "MRP2 is absent in the transport - deficient ( TR ( - ) ) Wistar rat mutant , so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2 - deficient rats with those in transport - competent Wistar rats .",
            "By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB .",
            "However , one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur .",
            "This prompted us to study the brain expression of P - glycoprotein ( Pgp ) , a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues , including the BBB , in TR ( - ) rats compared with nonmutant ( wild - type ) Wistar rats .",
            "METHODS : The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR ( - ) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry , by using a novel , highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219 , respectively .",
            "RESULTS : Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats , whereas such labeling was absent in TR ( - ) rats .",
            "TR ( - ) rats exhibited a significant up - regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild - type controls .",
            "No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections .",
            "A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine - induced seizures in wild - type Wistar rats .",
            "Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR ( - ) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : The data on TR ( - ) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB .",
            "Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds , the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB .",
            "Furthermore , our data suggest that TR ( - ) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain , without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp - enhancing events for this purpose ."

            "MATERIALS AND METHODS : We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1 - year period , from June 2003 to June 2004 , at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies ( n = 25 ) performed during this interval .",

            "He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy , and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg .",
            "Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC - mass spectrometry .",
            "RESULTS : Minutes after oral administration , the patient developed nausea , sweating and hypotension , and finally collapsed .",

            "Further signs were hyperhidrosis , hypersalivation , bronchorrhoea , and severe miosis ; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio - ventricular dissociation .",
            "High doses of atropine ( up to 50 mg per 24 hours ) , adrenaline and dopamine were necessary .",
            "The patient was extubated 1 week later .",

            "METHODS : The changes in pain thresholds were determined using mechanical stimuli - - the modification of the classic paw withdrawal test described by Randall - Selitto .",
            "RESULTS : The results of this paper confirm that inhibition of bradykinin receptors and inducible NO synthase but not neuronal NO synthase activity reduces diabetic hyperalgesia .",
            "Pretreatment with L - NOArg and L - NIL but not 7 - NI , significantly increases antihyperalgesic activity both HOE 140 and des Arg10 HOE 140 .",
            "It was also shown that both products of inducible NO synthase and neuronal NO synthase activation as well as bradykinin are involved in hyperalgesia produced by vincristine .",
            "Moreover , L - NOArg and 7 - NI but not L - NIL intensify antihyperalgesic activity of HOE 140 or des - Arg10HOE 140 in toxic neuropathy .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : Results of these studies suggest that B1 and B2 receptors are engaged in transmission of nociceptive stimuli in both diabetic and toxic neuropathy .",
            "In streptozotocin - induced hyperalgesia , inducible NO synthase participates in pronociceptive activity of bradykinin , whereas in vincristine - induced hyperalgesia bradykinin seemed to activate neuronal NO synthase pathway .",

            "Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy - responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96 - h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high - dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure ( CHF ) and the following pretreatment characteristics : presence of electrocardiogram ( EKG ) abnormalities , age , hypertension , prior cardiac history , smoking , diabetes mellitus , prior use of anthracyclines , and left - sided chest irradiation .",
            "RESULTS : Six of 61 women ( 10 % ) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31 % .",
            "Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide - related cardiac toxicity ( 10 % ) is comparable to previous recorded literature .",

            "BACKGROUND : Nicotine polacrilex lozenges deliver 25 % to 27 % more nicotine compared with equivalent doses of nicotine polacrilex gum .",
            "The increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge has raised questions about the relative safety of the lozenge and gum .",
            "OBJECTIVE : The objective of this study was to compare the safety profiles of the 4 - mg nicotine lozenge and 4 - mg nicotine gum in smokers with selected label - restricted diseases .",
            "METHODS : This was a multicenter , randomized , open - label study in adult smokers with heart disease , hypertension not controlled by medication , and / or diabetes mellitus .",
            "Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive the 4 - mg nicotine lozenge or 4 - mg nicotine gum .",
            "Safety assessments were made at baseline and at 2 , 4 , 6 , and 12 weeks after the start of product use .",
            "RESULTS : Nine hundred one patients were randomized to treatment , 447 who received the lozenge and 454 who received the gum ( safety population ) .",
            "The majority were women ( 52 . 7 % ) .",

            "Five hundred fifty - three patients , 264 taking the lozenge and 289 taking the gum , used the study product for > or = 4 days per week during the first 2 weeks ( evaluable population ) .",
            "The nicotine lozenge and nicotine gum were equally well tolerated , despite increased nicotine exposure from the lozenge .",
            "The incidence of adverse events in the 2 groups was similar during the first 2 weeks of product use ( evaluation population : 55 . 3 % lozenge , 54 . 7 % gum ) , as well as during the entire study ( safety population : 63 . 8 % and 58 . 6 % , respectively ) .",
            "Stratification of patients by sex , age , extent of concurrent smoking , extent of product use , and severity of adverse events revealed no clinically significant differences between the lozenge and gum .",
            "The most common adverse events were nausea ( 17 . 2 % and 16 . 1 % ; 95 % CI , - 3 . 7 to 6 . 0 ) , hiccups ( 10 . 7 % and 6 . 6 % ; 95 % CI , 0 . 5 to 7 . 8 ) , and headache ( 8 . 7 % and 9 . 9 % ; 95 % Cl , - 5 . 0 to 2 . 6 ) .",

            "PURPOSE : We reviewed the results of serum testosterone and prolactin determination in 1 , 022 patients referred because of erectile dysfunction and compared the data with history , results of physical examination , other etiological investigations and effects of endocrine therapy to refine the rules of cost - effective endocrine screening and to pinpoint actual responsibility for hormonal abnormalities .",
            "MATERIALS AND METHODS : Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay .",
            "Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire , gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng . / ml .",
            "Determination was repeated in case of abnormal first results .",
            "Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1 , 340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination .",
            "Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire , small testes and gynecomastia .",
            "Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia .",
            "RESULTS : Testosterone was less than 3 ng . / ml .",
            "in 107 patients but normal in 40 % at repeat determination .",
            "The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age ( 4 % before age 50 years and 9 % 50 years or older ) .",
            "Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination .",
            "Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction ( definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [ 36 % ] after androgen therapy , normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30 % and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42 % ) .",
            "Determining testosterone only in cases of low sexual desire or abnormal physical examination would have missed 40 % of the cases with low testosterone , including 37 % of those subsequently improved by androgen therapy .",
            "Prolactin exceeded 20 ng . / ml .",
            "in 5 men and was normal in 2 at repeat determination .",
            "Only 1 prolactinoma was discovered .",
            "These data are lower than those we found during the last 2 decades ( overall prolactin greater than 20 ng . / ml .",
            "in 1 . 86 % of 1 , 821 patients , prolactinomas in 7 , 0 . 38 % ) .",
            "Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml .",
            "( 8 of 12 compared to only 9 of 22 cases with prolactin between 20 and 35 ng . / ml . ) .",
            "Testosterone was low in less than 50 % of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng . / ml .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction can not justify their routine determination .",
            "However , cost - effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50 % of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors .",
            "We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years .",
            "Prolactin should be determined only in cases of low sexual desire , gynecomastia and / or testosterone less than 4 ng . / ml ."

            "Reduction in caffeine toxicity by acetaminophen .",
            "A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over - the - counter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate , caffeine , and acetaminophen displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of caffeine per mL of serum .",
            "Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS , attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen ( 52 micrograms / mL ) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine .",
            "Studies in DBA / 2J mice showed that : 1 ) pretreatment with acetaminophen ( 100 mg / kg ) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine ( 300 to 450 mg / kg IP ) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two ; and 2 ) pretreatment with acetaminophen ( 75 mg / kg ) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine ( 12 . 5 to 75 mg / kg IP ) .",
            "The frequency of sound - induced seizures after 12 . 5 or 25 mg / kg caffeine was reduced from 50 to 5 % by acetaminophen .",
            "In the absence of caffeine , acetaminophen ( up to 300 mg / kg ) did not modify the seizures induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of pentylenetetrezol in mice ( tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS ) .",
            "Acetaminophen ( up to 150 micrograms / mL ) did not retard the incorporation of radioactive adenosine into ATP in slices of rat cerebral cortex .",
            "Thus the mechanism by which acetaminophen antagonizes the actions of caffeine in the CNS remains unknown ."

            "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Rg1 on learning impairment by chronic morphine administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect .",
            "Male rats were subcutaneously injected with morphine ( 10 mg / kg ) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days , and Rg1 ( 30 mg / kg ) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of morphine once a day for 10 days .",

            "The results showed that rats treated with Morphine / Rg1 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency .",

            "The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that Rg1 restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with morphine , but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline - or morphine / Rg1 - treated rats ; this restoration could be inhibited by N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist MK801 .",

            "BACKGROUND : Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described , the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bruising and pain is little documented .",
            "DESIGN : This study was designed as within - subject , quasi - experimental research .",
            "METHOD : The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was administered .",
            "Heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site .",
            "Injections areas were assessed for the presence of bruising at 48 and 72 hours after each injection .",
            "Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper .",
            "The visual analog scale ( VAS ) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop - watch was used to time the pain period .",
            "Data were analysed using chi - square test , Mann - Whitney U , Wilcoxon signed ranks tests and correlation .",
            "RESULTS : The percentage of bruising occurrence was 64 % with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42 % in the 30 - second injection .",
            "It was determined that the size of the bruising was smaller in the 30 - second injection .",
            "Pain intensity and pain period were statistically significantly lower for the 30 - second injection than for the 10 - second injection .",
            "CONCLUSIONS : It was determined that injection duration had an effect on bruising and pain following the subcutaneous administration of heparin .",
            "This study should be repeated on a larger sample .",
