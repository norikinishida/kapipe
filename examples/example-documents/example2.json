        "All the adverse effects of heparins are related to their wide variety of biological activities , with bleeding being the most important safety issue , resulting directly from the potency of heparin as an anticoagulant .",
        "However , it is hard to define the bleeding risk , since it depends on numerous parameters including the indication , dosage , method , and duration of heparin application , the clinical study design and definition of bleeding as well as patient characteristics and determinants of bleeding such as type of surgery and co - medication .",
        "Nonbleeding complications of heparins are caused by binding of heparin molecules to proteins other than antithrombin and to cells , which is generally more pronounced with unfractionated heparin than with low - molecular - weight heparins .",
        "Accordingly , heparin - induced thrombocytopenia , the most severe nonbleeding adverse reaction , occurs about 10 times less with low - molecular - weight heparins than with unfractionated heparin .",
        "Frequent and therefore important adverse reactions of heparins are skin lesions resulting from delayed - type hypersensitivity reactions .",
        "All the other undesirable effects are discussed as well , but they are mostly clinically irrelevant ."
